# server-public

Our server is used by multiple students and researchers associated with the chair of e-Finance of Prof. Gomber. The server resources are shared among those users. Therefore, please use resources such as CPU, RAM and GPU carefully so that all users get the best possible performance. The following guidelines can help you avoid unnecessary resource consumption.

## Guidelines in Short

1. Select the environment with resources as small as possible, as much as necessary. 

2. Work in your home folder. Use directory `/_shared_storage/temp` only if you want to share your results with other users.

2. Terminate kernels that are not required anymore. 

3. Shutdown your server after finishing your work.
